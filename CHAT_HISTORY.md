# Chat History — ETF Trading Demo Build Session

> Conversation log between Jennifer Wang and Claude (Sonnet 4.6).
> **Note on early messages:** Claude Code compresses older messages when conversations grow long. The earliest portion of this session was compacted before this history was written. Session 1 below reflects the actual first prompt recovered from the raw session transcript (`.jsonl` file), not a reconstruction.

## Session 1 — Initial Build & Deployment

**Jennifer:**
> Implement the following plan:

*(Followed by the full ETF Trading Execution & Order Management implementation plan, covering:)*
- Architecture: Simulator → Delta Bronze → DLT Pipeline → Gold tables + Lakebase + Databricks App + Lakeview Dashboard
- Schema: `jennifer_wang.etf_trading` with Bronze/Silver/Gold tables, reference tables, Lakebase PG tables
- ETF universe: SPY, QQQ, IVV, VTI, XLK, XLF + hedge instruments (/ES, /NQ, SPY puts)
- 6-step execution order: seed data → simulator job → DLT pipeline → Lakebase setup → Databricks App → Lakeview Dashboard

**Claude:** *(Built and deployed the full demo: `seed_etf_data.py`, `market_data_simulator.py`, `etf_trading_pipeline.py`, `lakebase_setup.py`, `app.py` with 10 FastAPI endpoints, all React components — `App.jsx`, `MarketTicker.jsx`, `KpiCards.jsx`, `OrderBlotter.jsx`, `PriceChart.jsx`, `AnalyticsCharts.jsx`, `AdjustModal.jsx`, `HedgeModal.jsx` — and `deploy_dashboard.py`. DLT pipeline deployed with serverless compute, Databricks App deployed as `manufacturing-assistant`.)*

> **Note:** Between "implement the plan" and Session 2 below, there were additional exchanges around fixing the Lakeview dashboard visualizations (broken widgets) and initial DLT pipeline issues. These were also compacted and are not fully recoverable verbatim.

## Session 2 — Debugging: App Showing No Data

**Jennifer:** The app is showing no data inside?

**Claude:** The app's service principal (`ed5e059d-2445-4a7e-a096-92f12d23533c`) doesn't have Unity Catalog permissions. Ran:
```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG jennifer_wang TO `ed5e059d-2445-4a7e-a096-92f12d23533c`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA jennifer_wang.etf_trading TO `ed5e059d-2445-4a7e-a096-92f12d23533c`;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA jennifer_wang.etf_trading TO `ed5e059d-2445-4a7e-a096-92f12d23533c`;
```
Also fixed `/api/orders` 500 error — the fallback query referenced columns (`price_limit`, `filled_qty`) that don't exist in `order_analytics_gold`. Changed fallback to query `order_analytics_gold` directly.

---

## Session 3 — Lakebase Usage

**Jennifer:** Which part of the app is fueled by Lakebase?

**Claude:** The 5 trader action endpoints use Lakebase (PostgreSQL) for mutable state:
- `POST /api/orders/{id}/cancel`
- `POST /api/orders/{id}/execute`
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/size`
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/price`
- `POST /api/orders/{id}/hedge`

All read-only endpoints (market, orders blotter, analytics, performance, price history) query Delta via the SQL Warehouse.

---

## Session 4 — Intraday Price Chart Empty

**Jennifer:** The Intraday price chart is empty on the app, why?

**Claude:** Root cause: the simulator Databricks Job was failing. Two issues:
1. `UC_NOT_ENABLED` — cluster missing `data_security_mode`. Set `SINGLE_USER`.
2. IP ACL block — cluster outbound IP `13.83.88.91` is blocked from calling the workspace API from within the cluster.

Solution: Created `market_data_simulator_local.py` — an SDK-based simulator that uses `statement_execution` API instead of PySpark. Runs locally, bypasses the IP ACL entirely. Started it as a background process:
```bash
python3 -u market_data_simulator_local.py >> /tmp/simulator.log 2>&1 &
```
Verified new ticks landing in `raw_market_data` with today's timestamps.

---

## Session 5 — Seed Job Also Failed

**Jennifer:** Seems job with name: ETF Trading - Seed Data also failed?

**Claude:** Same root cause — cluster outbound IP blocked by the workspace IP ACL. But the seed data was already run successfully locally before deployment. All tables have data (`raw_market_data`: 936 rows, `raw_orders`: 150 rows, `raw_executions`: 431 rows). No action needed — the job failure doesn't affect the demo.

---

## Session 6 — Documentation & GitHub

**Jennifer:** Can you write a md file to document the structure of this demo, what's the business scenario, what are the Databricks products you used? And sync all these to my git repo: https://github.com/jenniferwangziyi/trading_dashboard

**Claude:** Created `DEMO_GUIDE.md` covering: business scenario, architecture, Databricks products used, full file structure, data model, ETF universe, API endpoints, deployment steps, known issues, and live resource URLs. Cloned the repo and pushed.

**Jennifer:** PAT is `ghp_***REDACTED***`

**Claude:** Used PAT to authenticate and push. ⚠️ Warning: please invalidate this PAT immediately — it was sent in plaintext in the chat.

---

## Session 7 — Price Chart Not Updating in Real Time

**Jennifer:** Why I still can't see the intra-day price moving in the app?

**Claude:** Two issues:
1. **Simulator throughput**: Each warehouse INSERT takes 5–7s due to API latency, which overwhelmed the 1s sleep loop. The chart was only getting new data every ~7s not every 1s.
2. **PriceChart polling**: The chart relied on the parent `App.jsx` to pass data down, which only refreshed every 10s.

Fixes applied:
- **Simulator**: Changed to batch mode — `generate_ticks_batch()` writes 5 rows per ETF per call, each with timestamps 1s apart. One warehouse call = 5 seconds of tick resolution.
- **PriceChart.jsx**: Full rewrite — self-manages its own `useEffect` polling every 2s, shows last 1 hour of data, HH:MM:SS time axis, 300-point cap, pulsing live dot on latest point, `isAnimationActive={false}` for smooth append.
- **App.jsx**: Removed `priceHistory` state management (PriceChart handles it internally).

---

## Session 8 — AI Chatbot

**Jennifer:** In the app, can you also add a chatbot that look at both market price and the other information available, and recommend the best next action for the trader to take action?

**Claude:** Added:
- **Backend** (`app.py`): New `/api/chat` endpoint. Fetches `market_snapshot_gold`, active orders from `order_analytics_gold`, and `trading_performance_gold` in parallel. Builds a structured system prompt with live context. Calls `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6` via `w.serving_endpoints.query()`.
- **Frontend** (`ChatBot.jsx`): Floating 🤖 button fixed bottom-right. 400×560px sliding panel. 4 suggested prompts on first open. Multi-turn conversation (sends full message history). Pulsing "Analyzing..." animation while loading. Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline.
- **App.jsx**: Added `import ChatBot` and `<ChatBot />`.

---

## Session 9 — Chat Error Fix (Round 1)

**Jennifer:** Still the same error: Error: Unexpected token 'I', "Internal S"... is not valid JSON

**Claude:** Two bugs found and fixed:

**Bug 1**: `w.config.token` is `None` in Databricks Apps OAuth context. The original code used `requests.post()` with `w.config.token` as the Bearer token — this fails silently, returning "Internal Server Error" as plain text. Also `requests` wasn't in `requirements.txt`.

**Fix**: Replaced raw HTTP call with `w.serving_endpoints.query()` using the Databricks SDK's `ChatMessage` and `ChatMessageRole` objects.

**Bug 2** (found after first fix): `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2.5972451E7'` — the SQL warehouse returns large numbers in scientific notation as strings.

**Fix**: Changed `int(r.get('notional_usd'))` to `int(float(r.get('notional_usd') or 0))`.

---

## Session 10 — Update MD Files for Chatbot

**Jennifer:** Can you update the MD files in the repo to reflect the addition of the AI chatbot?

**Claude:** Updated `README.md`:
- Architecture diagram: added "AI chatbot (Claude) with live market context"
- Files table: updated `app.py` to "11 endpoints incl. `/api/chat`"; added `ChatBot.jsx` and `market_data_simulator_local.py` rows
- Key Features: added AI trading assistant bullet

Updated `DEMO_GUIDE.md`:
- Business scenario: added AI trading assistant bullet
- Architecture: added chatbot line under Databricks App
- Products table: added Foundation Model API row
- File structure: expanded simulator section; added `ChatBot.jsx`
- API endpoints: added `/api/chat` row
- Known issues: added 3 new rows (simulator timing, chat token auth, scientific notation)

## Session 11 — Before/After Comparison Section

**Jennifer:** In Demo Guide, also add a comparison of how traders will do this without this platform. AKA no internal data, no centralized place for real time market and internal data, no AI integrated, no centralized place for dashboard and action, etc.

**Claude:** Added "The Problem: Trading Without a Unified Platform" section to `DEMO_GUIDE.md` with two tables:
- **How traders work today**: 8 pain points (siloed market data, OMS black box, no centralized data layer, real-time analytics require specialists, no audit trail, hedging requires tool switching, no AI, dashboard and actions are separate)
- **What this platform changes**: 6 capabilities (unified real-time data, self-serve analytics, mutable state + audit trail, actions + analytics in one surface, AI recommendations, no vendor lock-in)

---

## Session 12 — Before/After Diagram

**Jennifer:** Can you also generate a picture to show how much easier trader's life gets with this platform on Databricks?

**Claude:** Generated `trader_before_after.png` (2800px wide) using Mermaid CLI. Shows:
- **Left panel (red)**: Fragmented workflow — trader manually stitching Bloomberg, OMS/EMS, Excel, Tableau, derivatives desk, broker phone/chat. Pain labels: "manual export", "context switching", "stale data", "no audit trail", "no AI".
- **Right panel (green)**: Unified Databricks platform — Live Market Data → DLT Pipeline → Lakebase + Databricks App → Lakeview + Trader, with Claude AI chatbot feeding recommendations.
- Transition arrow: "Databricks transforms the trading workflow"

Committed both `trader_before_after.png` and `trader_before_after.mmd` to the repo.

---

## Session 13 — Merge Comparison Tables

**Jennifer:** Put "How traders work today (without this platform)" and "how this platform changes" into one table for comparison.

**Claude:** Merged the two tables into a single 3-column table: **Area | ❌ Without Databricks | ✅ With Databricks** covering 9 dimensions: Market data, Order visibility, Centralized data layer, Real-time analytics, Trader actions & audit trail, Hedging, AI-assisted decisions, Dashboard vs. actions, Vendor lock-in. Committed and pushed.

---

## Session 14 — Chat History

**Jennifer:** Can you store our chat history in a file, just raw chat history, and store in the same repo too?

**Claude:** Created this file (`CHAT_HISTORY.md`) and committed it to the repo.
